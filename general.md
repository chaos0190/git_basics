## What is Version Control System 

VCS is a software tool that helps track and manage changes to a file or set of files.  
It usually tracks the modifications as versions and provides a way to -->  
- compare versions  
- Roll back changes
- see histories of changes
- parallel development through branches  

## What is a distributed version control system  

A distributed version control system (DVCS) is a type of version control system that allows multiple users to work on the same project simultaneously and independently, without requiring a centralized server.  
In a DVCS -->  
- every user has a complete copy of the repository, which means that they can make changes to their local copy without being connected to a central server.  
They can commit changes to their local repository and then synchronize their changes with other users' repositories when they reconnect to the network.
- provides several benefits, including the ability to work offline
- the ability to create branches and merge changes easily
- increased reliability because there is no single point of failure  

## What is the benefit of GIT 
- **Distributed version control:** Git is a distributed VCS, which means that every user has a complete copy of the repository, including the entire history of changes.  
This allows users to work offline and reduces the risk of losing data if the central repository goes down.
- **Branching and merging:** Git makes it easy to create branches and merge changes between them, allowing for parallel development and experimentation without interfering with the main codebase.
- **Incremental development and staging:** Git allows developers to commit changes incrementally and stage changes before committing them, **making it easier to manage complex changes and collaborate with other developers.**
- **Collaboration: Git makes it easy for multiple developers to work on the same codebase simultaneously and collaborate on changes, reducing the risk of conflicts and errors.**  
Git also provides tools for **code reviews and discussions,** making it easier for teams to collaborate and ensure code quality.
- **Security and traceability:** Git provides a **complete history of changes to the codebase, including who made the changes and when.** This can help with **debugging, auditing, and security, allowing developers to track down issues and trace the source of problems.**
